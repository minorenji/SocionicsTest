# SocionicsTest

This is a simple Jungian dichotomy test for Socionics Model A.

## Socionics
> Socionics, in psychology and sociology, is a pseudoscientific theory of information processing and personality types. It is distinguished by its information model of the psyche (called "Model A") and a model of interpersonal relations. It incorporates Carl Jung's work on Psychological Types with Antoni Kępiński's theory of information metabolism. Socionics is a modification of Jung's personality type theory that uses eight psychic functions, in contrast to Jung's model, which used only four. These functions are supposed to process information at varying levels of competency and interact with the corresponding function in other individuals, giving rise to predictable reactions and impressions—a theory of intertype relations. In contrast to the generally accepted views in science on age-related variability of the human psyche,socionics postulates the presence of 16 psychological types unchanged throughout life.

## Methodology
This test attempts to identify socionic type by measuring four different traits: Extraversion, Rationality, Ethics/Logic, and Intuition/Sensation. The 16 intersections of these 4 dichotomies produce the 16 different types of Socionics.

Some questions were adapted from the book *Psychological Types* by Viktor Gulenko, and others were developed by myself. The overall accuracy of the test is probably not too high, because personality tests inherently contain self-selection bias. People answer based on their often inaccurate self-perception.
